I like to develop R packages.

### [{circacompare}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circacompare/index.html)

Uses non-linear regression to statistically compare two circadian rhythms. Groups are only compared if both are rhythmic (amplitude is non-zero). Performs analyses regarding mesor, phase, and amplitude, reporting on estimates and statistical differences, for each, between groups. Details can be found in Parsons et al (2020) <doi:[10.1093/bioinformatics/btz730](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz730)>.

### [{simMetric}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simMetric/index.html)

Allows users to quickly apply individual or multiple metrics to evaluate Monte Carlo simulation studies.

### [{DSSP}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DSSP/index.html)

Draw samples from the direct sampling spatial prior model as described in G. White, D. Sun, P. Speckman (2019) <[arXiv:1906.05575](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05575)>. The basic model assumes a Gaussian likelihood and derives a spatial prior based on thin-plate splines..
