# Talks

#### Statistical Society of Australia QLD Branch Meeting: Considering patient outcomes and healthcare costs when obtaining prediction model cutpoints may improve value-based care (2022-08-03)

Presented on recent PhD work regarding both cutpoint selection (including work presented at Impact Makers) and a new wrapper R package ([predictNMB](https://github.com/RWParsons/predictNMB)) to simulate clinical prediction models, evaluating their net monetary benefit.

#### Impact Makers: Cost effectiveness-informed cutpoints for clinical prediction models (2022-07-15)

Presentation on recent PhD work where I propose a cutpoint selection method that maximises the net monetary benefit of a clinical prediction model.

#### Using shiny apps for effectively communicating research results to a broad audiencence (2022-06-17)

Presentation to the Center For Data Science at QUT about the basics of shiny app development and how they can be useful to researchers.

# Projects

I like working with health-related data and statistical programming. Fortunately, I've been able to work with a bunch of great people and across and range of interesting projects.

#### iTRAQI: injury Treatment & Rehabilitation Accessibility Queensland Index

iTRAQI (injury Treatment and Rehabilitation Accessibility Queensland Index) is a collaborative project involving Jamieson Trauma Institute (JTI), Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and representatives from Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) and Retrieval Services Queensland (RSQ), supported by the Australian Research Council through the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS) and QUT’s Centre for Data Science, with additional input from government, community members and clinicians.

I worked on this project as a Senior Research Assistant, performing the analyses and [shiny app](https://access.healthequity.link/) development. 

I'm currently authoring an online book (<https://rwparsons.github.io/interactive-maps/>) that describes the methods we used to perform the spatial data analyses and develop the shiny app.

#### Circadian rhythms

My honours project was interested in circadian rhythms and neuroanatomy. I ended up getting more interested in what methods we could use to compare circadian characteristics between two groups. This led to the development of CircaCompare (published in *[Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz730)*), which is accompanied by an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circacompare/index.html), a [shiny app](https://rwparsons.shinyapps.io/circacompare/), and an implementation in [python](https://github.com/RWParsons/circacompare_py).


I've been fortunate enough for this work to get some interest adn uptake. Since then, I've collaborated with groups at The University of Western Australia[^1], University of Lübeck[^2], Maastricht University[^3], and University of Saskatchewan[^4] in a range of different biomedical research projects.
