I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Health Policy Analysis](https://healthpolicy.com.au/) and PhD Candidate at [AusHSI](https://www.aushsi.org.au/). My PhD project involves clinical prediction model and statistical software development. Specifically, I'm working on prognostic models for inpatient falls using integrated electronical medical records data from Metro South Health and some software around evaluating/optimising clinical prediction models through the lens of value-based care.

In general, I enjoy learning new things, programming with R and python, and applied problems relating to healthcare and biomedical research.

Outside of research, I enjoy riding motorbikes, filter coffee and strength training.
