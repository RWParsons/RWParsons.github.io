I'm currently a Senior Data Scientist at [Nous group](https://nousgroup.com/people/rex-parsons?r=AU).

In my recently completed <a href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/251808/8/Rex%20Rajiv%20Whaddon%20Parsons%20Thesis.pdf">PhD</a> at <a href="https://www.aushsi.org.au/">AusHSI (QUT)</a>, I worked on prognostic models for inpatient falls using electronical medical records and developed software to evaluate/optimise clinical prediction models from a health economic perspective. At Nous, I spend most of my time either analysing health data for large healthcare evaluations or developing Shiny apps and R packages for both client facing or internal use.

In general, I enjoy learning new things, programming with R, and applied problems relating to healthcare and biomedical research.

Outside of work, I enjoy riding motorbikes, filter coffee and strength training.
