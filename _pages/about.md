I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Health Policy Analysis](https://healthpolicy.com.au/) and PhD Candidate at [AusHSI](https://www.aushsi.org.au/). My PhD project involves clinical prediction model and statistical software development. Within my PhD, I'm working on prognostic models for inpatient falls using electronical medical records data from Metro South Health and some developing software to evaluate/optimise clinical prediction models through the lens of value-based care. At HPA, I spend most of my time either analysing health data or developing Shiny apps and R packages.

In general, I enjoy learning new things, programming with R and python, and applied problems relating to healthcare and biomedical research.

Outside of research, I enjoy riding motorbikes, filter coffee and strength training.
