I'm currently a PhD Candidate at [AusHSI](https://www.aushsi.org.au/). My project involves clinical prediction model development and I'm working on prognostic models for inpatient falls using integrated electronical medical records data from Metro South Health.

I've also been involved with a range of Research Assistant roles at QUT while studying. Most recently I've worked on:

* estimating and [visualising](https://access.healthequity.link/) (in)equity of access to traumatic brain injury care across Queensland. (Supervised by Dr Susanna Cramb)
* developing [DSSP](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DSSP/index.html): an R-package to perform direct sampling for Bayesian spatial models. (Supervised by A/Prof Gentry White)
