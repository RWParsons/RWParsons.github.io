I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Nous group](https://nousgroup.com/people/rex-parsons?r=AU) and PhD Candidate at [AusHSI](https://www.aushsi.org.au/). 

Within my PhD, I've worked on prognostic models for inpatient falls using electronical medical records data from Metro South Health and developed software to evaluate/optimise clinical prediction models through the lens of value-based care. At Nous, I spend most of my time either analysing health data for evaluations or developing Shiny apps and R packages for both client facing or internal use.

In general, I enjoy learning new things, programming with R and python, and applied problems relating to healthcare and biomedical research.

Outside of research, I enjoy riding motorbikes, filter coffee and strength training.
